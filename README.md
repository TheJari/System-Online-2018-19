10565's code for Rover Ruckus.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Special thanks to https://github.com/acmerobotics for their Road Runner and FTC Dashboard projects, which are used in our code.

## Acknowledgements

The quickstart uses the fantastic [RevExtensions2 library](https://github.com/OpenFTC/RevExtensions2) to take advantage of REV Expansion Hub bulk reads (thanks @FROGbots-4634!).

## Installation

For more detailed instructions on getting Road Runner setup in your own project, see the [Road Runner README](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner#core).

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner-quickstart`.

1. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

1. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in `build.common.gradle`.
